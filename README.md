This doppelganger avali has 2 functions.

- You can record your behaviors and facial expressions. After recording, your doppelganger will appear on the spot you finished recording. You can play the record in real time.
- Other person can sit on your avatar. Once they sit, you can control their avatar. The other person sees how you are controlling their avatar. They can leave the sit and everything will go back to normal.

This is a medium size project. I already have a feeling this will be a funny project.
