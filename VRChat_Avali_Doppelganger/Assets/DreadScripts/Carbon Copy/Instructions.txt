Q- How can I setup multiple clones?
A- Just re-run the script! It'll automatically make each clone independent. Each clone can have its own settings!

Q- Is Carbon Copy compatible with VRChat Quest Avatars?
A- No, as VRChat Quest Avatars do not support Constraints at this time. Other clone systems are often not compatible either.

Q- How do I export Carbon Copy with my commercial package?
A- Assuming you have a commercial license for Carbon Copy, you will want to export the respective Generated Assets folder and the "Export" folder for Carbon Copy alongside the rest of your avatar package.
You can find these generated resources at Save File Path/GeneratedAssets/. By default, this is Assets/DreadScripts/Carbon Copy/GeneratedAssets/.
The folder for the Export can be found at Assets/DreadScripts/Carbon Copy/Export.

Q- Where can I request features/make suggestions?
A- Feel free to leave these in the #suggestions channel on DreadScripts and we can discuss them in more detail.

Q- My license key isn't working! / Can I change my license's device?.
A- Open a ticket on DreadScripts server or contact Dreadrith#3238 through Discord
